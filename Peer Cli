what is peer cli??

The Peer CLI is Fabric‚Äôs primary command-line interface tool used to interact with peer nodes in your network. It's provided through the Fabric peer binary, which you run directly in your terminal (typically inside the CLI Docker container or on your local host if Fabric binaries are installed).

üõ†Ô∏è What It Is
A client executable named peer ‚Äî located in the Fabric bin/ directory.

Used for many key operations:

Channel management: create/join/fetch/update channels

Chaincode lifecycle: install, package, approve, commit, query, invoke

Peer administration: check node status, manage logs, etc.

peer <subcommand> <action> [flags]
Examples:

peer channel create -o orderer.example.com:7050 ‚Ä¶

peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p path/to/cc

peer node status ‚Äî shows the running peer node state

üìå When You Use It
You typically use the Peer CLI:

Inside the CLI container (when using test-network):

bash
Copy
Edit
docker exec -it cli bash
On your host, with Fabric binaries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
export PATH=~/fabric-samples/bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=~/fabric-samples/config
Once set, you can run peer --help to see available commands or peer <subcommand> --help for more detail

üìö Handy Subcommands
Subcommand	Purpose
peer channel	Manage channels (create, join, update, fetch)
peer chaincode	Handle smart contracts (install, approve, query, invoke)
peer node	Control peer process (start, status)
peer logging	Retrieve or set logging levels
peer version	View peer's version information

‚úÖ Getting Started
Try these tests in your terminal or CLI container:

bash
Copy
Edit
peer --version
peer node status
peer channel list
peer chaincode list --installed
These commands confirm that the peer CLI is functional and properly linked to your network.

üéØ TL;DR
The Peer CLI (peer binary) is your go-to tool for peer-related operations in Fabric.

It supports channel, chaincode, node, and logging functionalities.

Make sure it's in your PATH, properly configured with FABRIC_CFG_PATH, and run commands inside your network context (CLI container or configured host).

Let me know if you‚Äôd like help with specific commands (e.g., installing chaincode or querying a channel) or troubleshooting the CLI setup!
