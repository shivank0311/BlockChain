Great! After successfully generating the channel creation transaction for universitychannel, the next steps in the Hyperledger Fabric workflow are:
1. Create the Channel on the Network
Use the generated transaction to create the channel on the orderer:
Apply to configtx.yam...
Run
2. Join Peers to the Channel
For each org (University1, University2, Org3, Org4), set the environment variables and join their peer to the channel:
Example for University1:
Apply to configtx.yam...
Run
Repeat for University2, Org3, and Org4 (adjusting the org, MSP, and port).
3. Set Anchor Peers (Optional but recommended)
For each org, set the anchor peer:
Apply to configtx.yam...
Run
(You need to generate anchor peer update transactions for each org if not already done.)
4. Deploy Chaincode
Package, install, approve, and commit your chaincode (e.g., "universityrecord") for all orgs on universitychannel.
5. Test the Network
Invoke and query the chaincode to ensure everything is working.
Would you like me to generate the exact commands or a script for all orgs to join the channel and deploy chaincode? If so, please specify the chaincode details (name, path, language, version, and if --init-required is needed), or say "use sample."
