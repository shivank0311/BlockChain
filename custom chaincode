🎉 Success! Custom Chaincode Deployed to Forest Channel
I have successfully deployed the custom wildlife chaincode to the forestchannel using JavaScript! Here's what was accomplished:
✅ Deployment Summary:
Created JavaScript Wildlife Chaincode - A complete chaincode with functions for:
Wildlife records (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Query)
Conservation projects (Create, Read, Query)
Advanced queries (by status, location, history)
Successfully Deployed using the network.sh script:
Apply to deploy-chain...
Run
   ./network.sh deployCC -ccn wildlife-chaincode -ccp ../blockchain-explorer-api/chaincode/custom-chaincode/ -ccl javascript -c forestchannel
Chaincode Status:
✅ Installed on both peers (Org1 and Org2)
✅ Approved by both organizations
✅ Committed to the forestchannel
✅ Version: 1.0, Sequence: 5
📋 Available Functions:
Wildlife Records:
CreateWildlifeRecord - Create new wildlife records
GetWildlifeRecord - Get specific wildlife record
UpdateWildlifeRecord - Update existing records
DeleteWildlifeRecord - Delete records
GetAllWildlifeRecords - Get all records
QueryWildlifeByStatus - Query by conservation status
QueryWildlifeByLocation - Query by location
GetWildlifeHistory - Get transaction history
Conservation Projects:

�� Integration with API:
The API at http://localhost:3000/api/wildlife is ready to interact with the deployed chaincode. The API includes:
RESTful endpoints for all chaincode functions
Swagger documentation
Mock data fallback for testing
Proper error handling
�� Next Steps:
Test the chaincode by invoking functions through the API
Create wildlife records using the API endpoints
Monitor transactions through Hyperledger Explorer
Extend functionality as needed
The custom wildlife chaincode is now successfully deployed and ready to use on the forestchannel! 🦁🌿
